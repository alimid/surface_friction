# A Decision Support System for Safer Airplane Landings
This repository contains scripts used to create machine learning models to predict runway surface conditions from weather data and runway reports. The files contains what you need to perform a classification (slippery / non-slippery) and a regression on the tire-to-road friction coefficient, as well as explaniable AI by calculating SHAP values for the predictions.

The scripts are used for the calculations done in this preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04010.
